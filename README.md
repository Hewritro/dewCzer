This is a HTML spartan customizer.

In order to customize a spartan you must:

Click on Arms/Chest/Helmet/Legs/Shoulders depending on which part you want to customize and then click on an armor type.

You can however move your mouse over the armor types and watch the spartan(just like dewritoupdater but slightly different).

TODO

html:
